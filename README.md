Pygame game: Conquest, a turn based strategy game of world domination

## Introduction
Conquest is a game I created to learn more about Pygame.
If you wish to contribute to this project you can contact me or create a pull request.

## Running
This game should run as-is with the following dependencies: `python 3.1` and `pygame`
install the pygame dependency:
Windows:
```
pip install pygame
```

ARCH-Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S python-pygame
```

Once `pygame` is installed run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Python-Sargent/conquest.git
cd Conquest
python init.py
```
The game should run.

## Special Notice
This project has been temporarily halted because of the many issues with pygame and the uncertainty between pygame and pygame-ce.
If at some point pygame-ce becomes available as a module package on my linux distro I will attempt to convert this project over to pygame-ce.
Until then, many thanks and I hope this project is interesting.

_this project is not based off of any game or product with the name Conquest and any such games or products have to bearing on this project_
